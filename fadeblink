  Blink Assignment by Ryan Boyd, student # 3180091

This program creates two fading LEDs, one starting before the other,and the second fading in faster and brighter. 
When both are at their luminescent peak, a third digital light is activated to beep 4 times.  
Then the two other LEDs fade out in reverse order and the loop starts over.

The circuit:
- 3 LEDs attached from pins 13(digital), ~11(analog), and ~10(analog) to ground.
