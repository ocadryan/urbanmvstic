//Light Sensing Assignment by Ryan Boyd, student # 3180091

//This program modulates 3 LEDs by first making them cycle through each of the three colours(red, blue, and green), until a button is pressed and held down.
//Once the button is held down, the 3 LEDs become reactive to 3 different intensities of light due to the photocell attached to the breadboard.  
//When a light is waved over them, the three LEDs light up and turn off in succession based on the 3 intensities of light.

//The circuit:
//
//3 LEDs attached from pins 13, 12, and 11 to ground.  
//A photocell and a button from pin A5 and 8 respectively are run through 2 10k resistors to ground.

 //First, set the digital pins 13, 12 and 11 as outputs, and set digital pin 8 as an input.  Then initiate the Serial monitor.
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(8, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  //log the status of the analog pin's feedback from the photocell, producing a light intensity value
  Serial.println(analogRead(5));
  //If the button is pushed, turn the 3 LEDs on, Red at the intensity of 550, Blue at 700 and Green at 900.
  if(digitalRead(8) == HIGH){
    
    if(analogRead(5) > 550) {
      digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
      Serial.println("Red light is activated by the light!");
      } else{
        digitalWrite(13, LOW);
        }
      
    if(analogRead(5) > 700) {
      digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
      Serial.println("Blue light is activated by light!");
      } else{
        digitalWrite(12, LOW);
        }
      
    if(analogRead(5) > 900) {
      digitalWrite(11, HIGH);
      Serial.println("Green light is activated by the light!");
      } else{
        digitalWrite(11, LOW);
        }
 //Otherwise, turn on and off red, then blue, then green at intervals of 100 miliseconds.     
  } else {
    digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(13,LOW);
    digitalWrite(12,HIGH);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(12,LOW);
    digitalWrite(11,HIGH);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(11,LOW);
    }
