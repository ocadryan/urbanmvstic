//Useless Machine Project by Ryan, Khrystyna, Matt & Giulia
//
//This program causes 2 servo motors to rotate at specific degrees depending on the light intensity received by the photocell.
//When the light intensity is between 525-700, the servos rotate between 80-0 & 100-180 degrees respectively.
//When the light intensity is above 700, the servos rotate to 90 degrees.
//
//The circuit: 
//
// 5v pin connected to the positive power rail on the breadboard
// Ground pin connected the negative power rail on the breadboard
// Photocell connected to the 5v power rail with a 10k resistor into analog pin 5.
// Two Servos connected to pin 9 & pin 11, as well as the 5v and ground power rails.
