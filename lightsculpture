//Light Sculpture Assignment by Ryan Boyd, student # 3180091

//This program fades in and out 1 large Blue LED every second until a button is pressed and held down.
//Once the button is held down, all 6 LEDs become reactive to whether the room is well-lit, due to the photocell attached to the breadboard.  
//When the program determines that the room is dark, 6 LEDs fade-in in succession.
//When the button is turned off, and all LEDs are turned off and Large Blue LED begins to fade in and out every second once again.

//The circuit:
//
//6 LEDs attached from pins 11, 10, 9, 6, 5 and 3 to ground.  
//A photocell and a button from pin A5 and 8 respectively are run through 2 10k resistors to ground.
