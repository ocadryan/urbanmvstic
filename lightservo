//Servo Assignment by Ryan Boyd, student #3180091
//
//This program causes a servo motor to rotate at specific degrees depending on the light intensity received by the photocell.
//When the light intensity is between 350-525, the servo rotates to 45 degrees.
//When the light intensity is between 525-700, the servo rotates to 90 degrees.
//When the light intensity is above 700, the servo rotates to 180 degrees.
//
//The circuit: 
//
// 5v pin connected to the positive power rail on the breadboard
// Ground pin connected the negative power rail on the breadboard
// Photocell connected to the 5v power rail with a 10k resistor into analog pin 5.
// Servo connected to pin 9, as well as the 5v and ground power rails.
